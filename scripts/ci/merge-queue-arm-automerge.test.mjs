// Behavioral test for the arming selector in scripts/ci/merge-queue-arm-automerge.sh
// (GOL-3118, ported to this repo by GOL-3150).
//
// What it protects:
//   Arming auto-merge hands a live pull request to GitHub with standing
//   instructions to merge it the moment its gates go green. A false positive
//   therefore merges something nobody decided to merge -- and it does so later,
//   asynchronously, with no run of this script anywhere near the event. So the
//   "stay quiet" direction is the safety-critical one and gets most of the
//   cases below.
//
//   Two skips are load-bearing beyond mere caution:
//     - `armed by <someone else>`: re-arming would mean disabling a human's
//       auto-merge first, silently taking a merge decision from its owner.
//     - `already in the merge queue`: the entry (and its identity) already
//       exists, so arming cannot fix a dead group. Only the rescue script can.
//       If this skip broke, a wedged PR would look handled and still be ejected.
//
//   As with merge-queue-rescue.test.mjs, the selector is extracted from the real
//   script rather than copied here, so the test cannot drift away from what runs.
//
// node builtins only -- run by the `CI scripts` job (scripts/ci/*.test.mjs).
