# Arm auto-merge under the agent App identity -- the PROACTIVE half of the
# merge-queue enqueue-identity fix (GOL-3118, parent GOL-2524).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# GitHub never creates workflow runs for events triggered by the default
# `GITHUB_TOKEN`. With a merge queue on `main`, `auto-approve.yml`'s
# `gh pr merge --squash` is an ENQUEUE, and an enqueue made by `GITHUB_TOKEN`
# builds a merge group that no `merge_group` workflow ever runs on: no required
# check reports, and GitHub ejects the PR unmerged ~30 min later.
# grove-sites' `scripts/ci/merge-queue-rescue.sh` cleans that up AFTER the fact,
# once per PR, forever (it takes `REPO=` -- point it at this repo).
#
# The permanent fix was thought to require an App private key in
# `secrets.MERGE_QUEUE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` so the workflow could mint a non-
# `GITHUB_TOKEN` identity for the enqueue call. It does not. Measured on
# 2026-10-06:
#
#   AUTO-MERGE INHERITS THE IDENTITY OF WHOEVER ENABLED IT.
#
# When auto-merge is armed on a PR, GitHub performs the eventual enqueue
# attributed to the identity that armed it -- and that enqueue creates runs
# normally. Evidence (`AutoMergeEnabledEvent.actor` vs the resulting
# `AddedToMergeQueueEvent.enqueuer`, grove-sites):
#
#   PR #921  armed by agenticos-developer 19:50:49Z -> enqueued by
#            agenticos-developer[bot] 20:10:25Z (20 min later, when checks went
#            green) -> ONE enqueue -> merged
#   PR #923  armed 20:12:22Z -> enqueued by the App 20:15:45Z -> merged
#   PR #933  armed 20:26:05Z -> enqueued by the App 20:31:54Z -> merged
#   PR #900  armed by EngineeringMoonBear -> enqueued as that human -> merged
#
#   #921's 20-minute gap is the load-bearing detail: arming happens BEFORE the
#   checks are green, GitHub does the waiting, and the enqueue it makes later
#   still carries the arming identity.
#
# PORTED FROM grove-sites (GOL-3150). The mechanism was proven there first
# (grove-sites #991, GOL-3118); this repo kept building dead merge groups for
# another day because the fix landed in one repo only. The same A/B has now
# been measured here too:
#
#   odoocker #729  enqueued by github-actions 22:05:24Z   ->  0 runs, hand-dequeued
#   odoocker #729  re-enqueued by the App     22:11:21Z   ->  merged in 37 s
#
# Confirmed deliberately, same queue, 68 seconds apart:
#
#   PR #990  enqueued by `github-actions` 02:05:51Z, group ba3e3f57 ->  0 runs
#   PR #987  armed as the App  02:06:59Z, group d16f97f1          ->  7 runs
#
# So the enqueue identity does NOT have to come from inside the workflow. Agents
# already hold one: every agent PR is authored by `agenticos-developer[bot]`
# using a broker-minted installation token. Arming auto-merge with that same
# token at PR-open time makes every subsequent enqueue healthy, with no Actions
# variable, no Actions secret, and no App private key copied anywhere.
#
# That matters beyond convenience. ADR-0001 keeps the App private key in
# `gh-token-broker` alone ("agents never see the root key"), and
# `.github/workflows/README-preview.md` commits CI to reading credentials from
# 1Password at runtime rather than storing them ("no static ... tokens live in
# GitHub secrets"). `MERGE_QUEUE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` would be the first long-lived
# root credential in Actions secrets, in three repos, to buy a capability the
# broker already gives away.
#
# WHY A DEAD ENTRY IS WORSE THAN IT LOOKS
#
# The merge queue is sequential. A dead entry at position 1 holds up every
# healthy entry behind it for the full eviction timeout -- on 2026-10-06, #990's
# dead group stalled #987 even though #987 had 7 green runs. The cost of a wedge
# is not one PR; it is the whole queue.
#
# STEADY STATE vs BACKSTOP
#
# The steady state is for whatever opens an agent PR to arm it in the same
# breath (see docs/RUNBOOK-merge-queue-enqueue-identity.md). This script is the
# backstop and the backlog drain: it sweeps already-open PRs and arms the ones
# that are safe to arm.
#
# It only ever arms PRs authored by the agent App. `auto-approve.yml` approves
# maintainer PRs but deliberately does not enqueue them, so that a human keeps
# control over when their own PR merges; arming theirs would take that back.
#
# This bypasses NO gate. Auto-merge is GitHub's own mechanism and still requires
# every required review and every required status check before it merges --
# including the protected-paths human review that `auto-approve.yml` withholds
# its approval for. Arming a PR only decides WHO enqueues it, not WHETHER it may
# merge.
#
# Do NOT run this from a GitHub Actions job on the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`: that
# is the identity that causes the wedge, so it would arm auto-merge as
# `github-actions` and rebuild the same dead group.
#
#   Dry run (default):   scripts/ci/merge-queue-arm-automerge.sh
#   Apply:               scripts/ci/merge-queue-arm-automerge.sh --apply
#   Every open PR:       ARM_UNAPPROVED=1 scripts/ci/merge-queue-arm-automerge.sh --apply
#   Other repo:          REPO=Goldberry-Playground/grove-sites ... --apply
#
# Env:
#   GH_TOKEN_BROKER_URL    broker base URL      (default http://gh-token-broker:9099)
#   GH_BROKER_API_KEY_FILE broker API key path  (default /paperclip/gh-broker.key)
#   REPO                   owner/name           (default Goldberry-Playground/odoocker-goldberrygrove)
#   BRANCH                 queue branch         (default main)
#   APP_LOGIN              arming identity      (default agenticos-developer)
#   APP_AUTHOR_LOGIN       PR-author login to match (default $APP_LOGIN)
#   ARM_UNAPPROVED         1 = arm PRs that are not approved yet (default 0)
#   ARM_PROTECTED          1 = also pre-arm UNAPPROVED protected-path PRs
#                          (default 0 -- needs a board decision, see below)
#
# ARM_UNAPPROVED is the conservative/steady-state switch. Default 0 arms only
# already-APPROVED PRs -- exactly the set `auto-approve.yml` has already decided
# to merge, so arming them changes nothing but the enqueuing identity. But that
# default is also structurally TOO LATE to be the steady state: by the time
# auto-approve.yml has approved a PR it has already performed the enqueue on
# `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is the wedge. Useful arming happens BEFORE approval, so
# an automated sweep has to run with ARM_UNAPPROVED=1.
#
# Pre-approval arming is only a semantic change for ONE class of PR (GOL-3118):
# an agent PR that touches a protected path. auto-approve.yml hard-withholds its
# approval there, so such a PR waits for a human review -- and pre-arming it
# would make that human's approval *be* the merge, instead of a reviewer
# approving and someone then deciding to enqueue. For every OTHER agent PR,
# auto-approve.yml was going to approve and enqueue it anyway, so pre-arming
# changes nothing but the enqueuing identity.
#
# So ARM_UNAPPROVED=1 skips unapproved protected-path PRs, using the TARGET
# repo's own base-branch `scripts/ci/protected-paths-carveout.mjs` -- the same
# definition auto-approve.yml withholds on, read from the base branch so a PR
# cannot edit the carve-out to un-protect itself. That makes ARM_UNAPPROVED=1
# safe to automate with no board decision attached. ARM_PROTECTED=1 is the
# separate, explicit override for the protected class; do not set it without
# the board's sign-off.
#
# Fail-closed: if the carve-out cannot be fetched or evaluated, or the PR's
# changed-file list came back truncated, an UNAPPROVED PR is skipped. An
# already-APPROVED PR is unaffected by any of this -- its approval already
# happened, so there is no approval-timing semantics left to change.
